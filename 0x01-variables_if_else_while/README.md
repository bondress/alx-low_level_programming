0-positive_or_negative.c is a C program that will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.
- The output of the program is:
	* The number, followed by:
		+ "is positive", if the number is greater than 0
		+ "is zero", if the number is 0
		+ "is negative", if the number is less than 0
	* followed by a new line.

1-last_digit.c is a C program that assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.
- The output of the program is:
	* The string 'Last digit of ', followed by 'n', followed by 'is', followed by:
		+ 'and is greater than 5' if the last digit of n is greater than 5.
		+ 'and is 0' if the last digit of n is 0.
		+ 'and is less than 6 and not 0' if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0.
	* followed by a new line.

2-print_alphabet.c is a C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. (You can only use the putchar function)

3-print_alphabets.c is a C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line. You can only use the putchar function.

4-print_alphabt.c is a C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line (except q and e). I only used the putchar function, others were not allowed.

5-print_numbers.c is a C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

6-print_numbersz.c is a C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. (Not allowed: type char, functions printf, puts and others like it).

7-print_tebahpla.c is a C program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line. (Only putchar function allowed).

8-print_base16.c is a C program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line. (Only putchar function allowed.)

9-print_comb.c is a C program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
- Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
- Numbers should be printed in ascending order
- You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etcâ€¦) is forbidden)
- All your code should be in the main function
- You can only use putchar four times maximum in your code
- You are not allowed to use any variable of type char
