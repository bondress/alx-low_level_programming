**0-strcat.c** is a C function that concatenates two strings. This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte.

**1-strncat.c** is a C function that concatenates two strings. This is similar to the previous function, except that:
- it will use at most n bytes from src; and
- src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes.

**2-strncpy.c** is a C function that copies a string. It works exactly like strncpy.

**3-strcmp.c** is a C function that compares two strings. It works exactly like strcmp.

**4-rev_array.c** is a C function that reverses the content of an array of integers.
