	* The number, followed by:
		+ "is positive", if the number is greater than 0
		+ "is zero", if the number is 0
		+ "is negative", if the number is less than 0

		+ 'and is less than 6 and not 0' if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0.
	* followed by a new line.

2-print_alphabet.c is a C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. (You can only use the putchar function)

3-print_alphabets.c is a C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line. You can only use the putchar function.

4-print_alphabt.c is a C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line (except q and e). I only used the putchar function, others were not allowed.
