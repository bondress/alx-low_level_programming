**0-strcat.c** contains a C function that concatenates two strings. This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte.

**1-strncat.c** contains a C function that concatenates two strings. This is similar to the previous function, except that:
- it will use at most n bytes from src; and
- src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes.

**2-strncpy.c** contains a C function that copies a string. It works exactly like strncpy.

**3-strcmp.c** contains a C function that compares two strings. It works exactly like strcmp.

**4-rev_array.c** contains a C function that reverses the content of an array of integers.

**5-string_toupper.c** contains a C function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.

**6-cap_string.c** contains a C function that capitalizes all words of a string. Separators of words: space, tabulation, new line, ,, ;, ., !, ?, ", (, ), {, and }

**7-leet.c** contains a C function that encodes a string into 1337.
- Letters a and A should be replaced by 4
- Letters e and E should be replaced by 3
- Letters o and O should be replaced by 0
- Letters t and T should be replaced by 7
- Letters l and L should be replaced by 1
- Prototype: char *leet(char *);
- You can only use one if in your code
- You can only use two loops in your code
- You are not allowed to use switch
- You are not allowed to use any ternary operation

**100-rot13.c** contains a C function that encodes a string using rot13.

**101-print_number.c** contains a C function that prints an integer.

**Task 10**
Add one line to the given code, so that the program prints a[2] = 98, followed by a new line.
- You are not allowed to use the variable a in your new line of code
- You are not allowed to modify the variable p
- You can only write one statement
- You are not allowed to use ,
- You are not allowed to code anything else than the line of expected line of code at the expected line
- Your code should be written at line 19, before the ;
- Do not remove anything from the initial code (not even the comments)
- and don’t change anything but the line of code you are adding (don’t change the spaces to tabs!)
- You are allowed to use the standard library

**Task 11**
A function that adds two numbers.
